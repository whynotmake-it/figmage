This guide will teach you how to get Figmage running to add tokens directly to your existing Flutter app.

At the end of this guide, you will have added your Figma design tokens to your Flutter app, completely automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, we assume that you have a few things ready.

<Card title="Figma Credentials" icon="seti:figma" >
You'll need your Figma file ID and a personal access token.
See the [Obtaining Figma Credentials](/guides/figma-credentials) guide for instructions.
</Card>

<Card title="Design Tokens" icon="open-book" >
You'll need at least some design tokens in your Figma file.
See the [Design Tokens](/reference/tokens-best-practices) reference for instructions.
</Card>

## Install Figmage CLI

First, install the Figmage CLI by running:

```bash
dart pub global activate figmage
```

## Configure Figmage

<Steps>
1. Create a `figmage.yaml` configuration file in your Flutter app's root directory.

    ```bash
    touch figmage.yaml
    ```

2. Configure `figmage.yaml` with the following essential settings:

    ```yaml
    # figmage.yaml
    fileId: "YOUR_FIGMA_FILE_ID"
    asPackage: false
    tokenPath: "design" # or any other path under lib
    ```

    The key settings for app integration are:
    - `asPackage: false` - This tells Figmage not to generate a standalone package
    - `tokenPath: "design"` - Specifies where to create token files within your app's `lib` directory

3. Customize which tokens to generate:

    ```yaml
    # Additional configuration options
    colors:
      generate: true
    typography:
      generate: true
      useGoogleFonts: true
    numbers:
      generate: false
    spacers:
      generate: false
    paddings:
      generate: false
    ```

4. Optionally filter tokens by path:

    ```yaml
    # Generate only specific token paths if needed
    colors:
      generate: true
      from:
        - "semantic/app/"
    typography:
      generate: true
      from:
        - "semantic/typography"
    ```
</Steps>

## Run Figmage

From your Flutter app's root directory, run:

```bash
figmage forge -t YOUR_FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

If you don't have your file ID or personal access token yet, see the [Obtaining Figma Credentials](/guides/figma-credentials) guide.

Figmage will fetch your Tokens from Figma and generate the Dart code directly within your app.
Pay attention to the output in your terminal.
Unless you are running Figmage with an Enterprise Figma account, you will see an error message:
```bash {1}
âœ— Failed to fetch variables: Unauthorized. Make sure you have a valid access token that can access the file and that you are a Figma Enterprise team member. (0.7s)
âœ“ Found ... styles (3.0s)
âœ“ Generated files at ... (0.1s)
...
```
This is expected and does not affect the generation of your Style-based Tokens.
Take a look at the [Figma Account Requirements](/reference/account-requirements) for more information.

## Structure After Generation

Your app's directory structure should now include the generated token files:

<FileTree>
- my_flutter_app/
  - lib/
    - design/
      - colors.dart
      - typography.dart
      - ...
    - main.dart
    - ...
  - figmage.yaml
  - pubspec.yaml
</FileTree>

The generated token files will follow the same structure as in the package approach. You will notice that Figmage generated a class for each of your top-level Token collections.

:::tip
If you have many top-level collections in Figma, you will see a lot of classes in these Dart files.

This might complicate the usage of your tokens in your Flutter app, so we recommend you to limit yourself to
a few top-level collections and use nested structures for more detailed Tokens.
A good start is grouping your collections by their type, like `primitive`, `semantic`, and `component`.

## Update Dependencies

Since tokens are now part of your app, you'll need to ensure you have the necessary dependencies:

<Steps>
1. Open your app's `pubspec.yaml` file

2. Add required dependencies:

    ```yaml
    # pubspec.yaml
    dependencies:
      flutter:
        sdk: flutter
      google_fonts: ^6.1.0 # Only if useGoogleFonts: true
    ```

3. Run flutter pub get:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
</Steps>

## Using Tokens in your App

<Steps>
1. Add the generated Tokens to your app's `Theme`

    Figmage generates [`ThemeExtension`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeExtension-class.html)
    classes, which you will need to add to your app's `ThemeData` to use them.

    ```dart
    // lib/main.dart
    import 'design/colors.dart';
    import 'design/typography.dart';
    // ...
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(
        theme: ThemeData(
          // ...
          extensions: [
            ColorsSemantic.standard(), // or .light() if you have modes
            TypographySemantic.standard(),
          ],
        ),
        // Add dark theme if you have it
        darkTheme: ThemeData(
          // ...
          extensions: [
            ColorsSemantic.dark(), // Only if you have a dark mode
            TypographySemantic.standard(),
          ],
        ),
        themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
        home: MyHomePage(),
      );
    }
    ```

2. Use your Tokens in your widgets:

    ```dart
    // lib/example_button.dart
    import 'design/colors.dart';
    import 'design/typography.dart';
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    class ExampleButton extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return ElevatedButton(
          style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
            backgroundColor: context.colorsSemantic.surfacePrimary,
            foregroundColor: context.colorsSemantic.onSurfacePrimary,
            textStyle: context.typographySemantic.headline1,
          ),
          onPressed: () {},
          child: Text('Click me!'),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
</Steps>

## Updating Tokens

Whenever your design tokens change in Figma, simply rerun the Figmage command:

```bash
figmage forge -t YOUR_FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

This will update all token files in your app with the latest changes from Figma.
