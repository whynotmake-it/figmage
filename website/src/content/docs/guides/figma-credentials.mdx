This guide will help you obtain the necessary Figma credentials to use with Figmage.

## What you need

Before you start, we assume that you have a few things ready.

<CardGrid>
<Card title="Figma Design File" icon="document" >
You should have a Figma file that represents your Design System, or just a simple app design. 
In both cases, you should have at least a few Tokens defined in your file.
</Card>
<Card title="Figma Account" icon="laptop" >
In most cases, you will only need an account that can access the file you want to sync with your project.
However, if you are using Variables in Figma, you might need a paid plan.

## Getting Your Figma File ID

<Steps>
1. Open your design file in Figma.

2. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. It will look something like:
   ```
   https://www.figma.com/file/abcdef123456/Your-Design-File-Name
   ```

3. The part after `/file/` and before the next slash is your file ID:
   ```
   abcdef123456
   ```

4. Alternatively, click the "Share" button in the top right corner of Figma and then "Copy link." The file ID will be in the copied URL.
</Steps>

## Generating a Figma Personal Access Token

<Steps>
1. Log in to your Figma account.

2. Navigate to your account settings by clicking on your profile picture in the top-right corner and selecting "Settings."

3. Navigate to the "Security" tab.

4. Click "Generate new token."

5. Give your token a name (e.g., "Figmage Integration"), as well as an expiration date.

6. Make sure your token has the following permissions:
   - **Files content**: Read only
   - **Library content**: Read only
   - **Variables**: Read only (if you have access to them)

7. Click "Generate token."

8. **Important**: Copy your token immediately and store it securely. Figma will only show it once.
</Steps>

## Security Considerations

<Card title="Never commit tokens" icon="warning">
Always keep your personal access token secure. Consider using environment variables or a secure secret management system.
</Card>

<Card title="Limit token scope" icon="seti:json">
Figma tokens have full access to all your files. Only generate tokens when needed and regenerate them periodically.
</Card>

## Using Your Credentials with Figmage

Your Figma file ID can be added to your `figmage.yaml` configuration file:

```yaml
fileId: "abcdef123456"
```

Your personal access token should be passed as a command-line argument when running Figmage:

```bash
figmage forge -t YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

You can also set up an environment variable for your token:

```bash
export FIGMA_TOKEN=YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
figmage forge -t $FIGMA_TOKEN
```
