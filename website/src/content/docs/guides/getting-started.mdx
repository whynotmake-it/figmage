This guide will teach you how to get Figmage running and set you up for success.

At the end of this guide, you will have a finished Flutter package that contains all your Tokens as Dart code. Exciting, right?

:::tip[Alternative Approach]
Looking to add tokens directly to your existing Flutter app instead of generating a separate package? 
Check out the [Add to your App](/guides/add-to-app) guide.

## What you need

Before you start, we assume that you have a few things ready.

<CardGrid>

<Card title="Figma Design File" icon="document" >
You should have a Figma file that represents your Design System, or just a simple app design. 
In both cases, you should have at least a few Tokens defined in your file.
</Card>


<Card title="Figma Account" icon="laptop" >
In most cases, you will only need an account that can access the file you want to sync with your project.
However, if you are using Variables in Figma, you might need a paid plan.

## Install Figmage

First, you need to install the Figmage CLI. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dart pub global activate figmage
```

## Create your Tokens Package

Next, decide where you want the generated package to live. 
You can create the package anywhere on your machine, use a monorepo, check it into your version control system separately, or even publish it to pub.dev.

<Steps>
1. Decide on a name and location for your package.
    Make sure to follow the Dart package naming conventions when choosing a name.
2. Create a directory with that name for your package to live in.
    Let's say you want to call your package `design_tokens`, you would run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    mkdir design_tokens
    ```
3. Create a `figmage.yaml` file in the root of your package directory.
    While this is not strictly necessary, it is recommended to have a `figmage.yaml` file in the root of your package directory. 
    This file will contain the configuration for Figmage.
    
    ```bash
    touch design_tokens/figmage.yaml
    ```

    Your package directory should now look like this:

    <FileTree>
    - design_tokens
        - figmage.yaml
    </FileTree>
</Steps>

## Tell Figmage where to find your Tokens

Now that you have your package set up, you need to tell Figmage where to find your Tokens in Figma.

<Steps>
1. Get your Figma file's ID.
    You can find the ID of your Figma file in the URL when you have the file open in your browser.
    It looks something like this:
    ```
    https://www.figma.com/design/<<your-file-id>>/...
    ```
    An easy way to obtain the link from the Figma app is to click the Share button in the top right corner of the app
    and select the **Copy link** option.
2. Add the Figma file ID to your `figmage.yaml` file.
    Open the file you created earlier and add the following content:
    ```diff lang=yaml
    // figmage.yaml
    + fileId: <<your-file-id>>
    ```
3. Obtain a Personal Access Token from Figma.
    
    You can generate a Personal Access Token in the Figma app by going to your account settings and selecting the **Generate new token** option.
    Make sure to copy the token to a safe place, as you will not be able to see it again.

    :::caution
    To prevent accidental leaks, Figmage does not allow adding your Personal Access Token directly to the `figmage.yaml` file.
    You have to pass it as input every time you run Figmage. 
    You can store your access token in an environment variable or a secret manager and use it from there.
    :::
</Steps>


## Run Figmage âœ¨

Now that you have everything set up, you can run Figmage to generate your Tokens package.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your package directory in your terminal.
    ```bash
    cd design_tokens
    ```
2. Run Figmage with the following command:
    ```bash
    figmage forge -t <<your-personal-access-token>>
    ```
    Replace `<<your-personal-access-token>>` with the Personal Access Token you obtained earlier.
3. Let Figmage do its magic.
    
    Figmage will now fetch your Tokens from Figma and generate the Dart code for your package.
    Pay attention to the output in your terminal.
    Unless you are running Figmage with an Enterprise Figma account, you will see an error message:
    ```bash {1}
    âœ— Failed to fetch variables: Unauthorized. Make sure you have a valid access token that can access the file and that you are a Figma Enterprise team member. (0.7s)
    âœ“ Found ... styles (3.0s)
    âœ“ Generated package at ... with ... files (0.1s)
    ...
    ```
    This is expected and does not affect the generation of your Style-based Tokens.
    Take a look at the [Figma Account Requirements](/reference/account-requirements) for more information.
</Steps>

## Inspect the generated package
If everything went well, you should now have a Dart package in your package directory that contains all your Tokens as Dart code.

Your package should look something like this:

<FileTree>
- design_tokens/
    - lib/
        - src/
            - colors.dart
            - typography.dart
            - ...
        - design_tokens.dart
    - figmage.yaml
    - pubspec.yaml
</FileTree>

Go ahead and open one of the files in the `src` directory to see your Tokens as Dart code. 
You will notice that Figmage generated a class for each of your top-level Token collections.

So if your Tokens were structured like this in Figma:

```plaintext
semantic
â”œâ”€â”€ surface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ primary
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ secondary
â””â”€â”€ onSurface
    â”œâ”€â”€ primary
    â””â”€â”€ secondary
```

You will see a Dart class like this in your `colors.dart` file:
```dart
// design_tokens/lib/src/colors.dart

// ...
class ColorsSemantic extends ThemeExtension<ColorsSemantic> {
  const ColorsSemantic({
    required this.surfacePrimary,
    required this.surfaceSecondary,
    required this.onSurfacePrimary,
    required this.onSurfaceSecondary,
  });

  // ...
}
```

:::tip
If you have many top-level collections in Figma, you will see a lot of classes in this Dart file.

This might complicate the usage of your tokens in your Flutter app, so we recommend you to limit yourself to
a few top-level collections and use nested structures for more detailed Tokens.
A good start is grouping your collections by their type, like `primitive`, `semantic`, and `component`.
:::

## âœ… Using your Tokens in your Flutter app

Now that you have your Tokens as Dart code, you can use them in your Flutter app.

<Steps>
1. Add your Tokens package as a dependency to your Flutter app.

    Open the `pubspec.yaml` file of your Flutter app and add the following line to the `dependencies` section:
    ```diff lang=yaml
    // pubspec.yaml

    dependencies:
    +  design_tokens:
    +    path: relative/path/to/your/design_tokens/
    ```

    If you decided to give your package a different name, make sure to replace `design_tokens` with the name you chose.
2. Add the generated Tokens to your app's `Theme`

    Figmage generates [`ThemeExtension`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeExtension-class.html)
    classes, which you will need to add to your app's `ThemeData` to use them.

    For example, this is how you would add the generated `ColorsSemantic` and `TypographySemantic` to your app's `ThemeData`:
    ```diff lang=dart
    // lib/main.dart
    + import 'package:design_tokens/design_tokens.dart';
    // ...
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(
        theme: ThemeData(
          // ...
    +      extensions: [
    +        ColorsSemantic.standard(),
    +        TypographySemantic.standard(),
    +      ],
        ),
        home: MyHomePage(),
      );
    }
    

    ```

    If your Tokens were generated from Variables, you will get multiple contructors, one for each mode.
    Let's say you have a `dark` and a `light` mode, you would use them like this:
    ```diff lang=dart
    // lib/main.dart

    + import 'package:design_tokens/design_tokens.dart';
    // ...
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(
        theme: ThemeData(
            // ...
            extensions: [
    +            ColorsSemantic.light(),
    +            TypographySemantic.standard(),
            ],
        ),
        darkTheme: ThemeData(
            // ...
            extensions: <ThemeExtension<dynamic>>[
    +            ColorsSemantic.dark(),
    +            TypographySemantic.standard(),
            ],
        ),
        themeMode: isLightTheme ? ThemeMode.light : ThemeMode.dark,
        home: MyHomePage(),
      );
    }
    ```

3. Use your Tokens in your app
     
    You are ready to use your tokens wherever you want!

    ```dart {11-13}
    // lib/example_button.dart

    import 'package:design_tokens/design_tokens.dart';
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    class ExampleButton extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return ElevatedButton(
          style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
            backgroundColor: context.colorsSemantic.surfacePrimary,
            foregroundColor: context.colorsSemantic.onSurfacePrimary,
            textStyle: context.typographySemantic.headline1,
          ),
          onPressed: () {},
          child: Text('Click me!'),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
</Steps>

That's it! You now have your Tokens as Dart code in your Flutter app. ðŸŽ‰

Whenever your Tokens change in Figma, you can run Figmage again in the same directory 
to automatically update your package with the latest changes.
