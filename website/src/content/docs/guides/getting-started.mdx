This guide will teach you how to get Figmage running to generate a standalone design package.

At the end of this guide, you will have a finished Flutter package that contains all your Tokens as Dart code.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, we assume that you have a few things ready.

<Card title="Figma Credentials" icon="figma" >
You'll need your Figma file ID and a personal access token.
See the [Obtaining Figma Credentials](/guides/figma-credentials) guide for instructions.
</Card>

<Card title="Design Tokens" icon="open-book" >
You'll need at least some design tokens in your Figma file.
See the [Design Tokens](/reference/tokens-best-practices) reference for instructions.
</Card>

<Card title="Flutter App" icon="rocket">
An existing Flutter app where you want to use the design tokens package.

## Install Figmage CLI

First, install the Figmage CLI by running:

```bash
dart pub global activate figmage
```

## Create your Tokens Package

Next, decide where you want the generated package to live. 
You can create the package anywhere on your machine, use a monorepo, check it into your version control system separately, or even publish it to pub.dev.

<Steps>
1. Decide on a name and location for your package.
    Make sure to follow the Dart package naming conventions when choosing a name.

2. Create a directory with that name for your package to live in.
    Let's say you want to call your package `design_tokens`, you would run the following command:
    ```bash
    mkdir design_tokens
    ```

3. Create a `figmage.yaml` file in the root of your package directory.
    While this is not strictly necessary, it is recommended to have a `figmage.yaml` file in the root of your package directory. 
    This file will contain the configuration for Figmage.
    
    ```bash
    touch design_tokens/figmage.yaml
    ```

    Your package directory should now look like this:

    <FileTree>
    - design_tokens
        - figmage.yaml
    </FileTree>
</Steps>

## Configure Figmage

<Steps>
1. Open the `figmage.yaml` file you created earlier and add your Figma file ID:
    ```yaml
    # figmage.yaml
    fileId: "YOUR_FIGMA_FILE_ID"
    ```

    If you don't have your file ID yet, see the [Obtaining Figma Credentials](/guides/figma-credentials) guide.

2. Optionally, configure additional settings as needed:
    ```yaml
    # Additional configuration options
    colors:
      generate: true
    typography:
      generate: true
      useGoogleFonts: true
    numbers:
      generate: true
    spacers:
      generate: true
    ```

3. For more detailed configuration, see the [Configuration Options](/reference/configuration-options) reference.
</Steps>

## Run Figmage

From your package directory, run:

```bash
figmage forge -t YOUR_FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

If you don't have your personal access token yet, see the [Obtaining Figma Credentials](/guides/figma-credentials) guide.

Figmage will fetch your Tokens from Figma and generate the Dart code for your package.
Pay attention to the output in your terminal.
Unless you are running Figmage with an Enterprise Figma account, you will see an error message:
```bash {1}
âœ— Failed to fetch variables: Unauthorized. Make sure you have a valid access token that can access the file and that you are a Figma Enterprise team member. (0.7s)
âœ“ Found ... styles (3.0s)
âœ“ Generated package at ... with ... files (0.1s)
...
```
This is expected and does not affect the generation of your Style-based Tokens.
Take a look at the [Figma Account Requirements](/reference/account-requirements) for more information.

## Structure After Generation

If everything went well, you should now have a Dart package in your package directory that contains all your Tokens as Dart code.

Your package should look something like this:

<FileTree>
- design_tokens/
    - lib/
        - src/
            - colors.dart
            - typography.dart
            - ...
        - design_tokens.dart
    - figmage.yaml
    - pubspec.yaml
</FileTree>

Go ahead and open one of the files in the `src` directory to see your Tokens as Dart code. 
You will notice that Figmage generated a class for each of your top-level Token collections.

So if your Tokens were structured like this in Figma:

```plaintext
semantic
â”œâ”€â”€ surface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ primary
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ secondary
â””â”€â”€ onSurface
    â”œâ”€â”€ primary
    â””â”€â”€ secondary
```

You will see a Dart class like this in your `colors.dart` file:
```dart
// design_tokens/lib/src/colors.dart

// ...
class ColorsSemantic extends ThemeExtension<ColorsSemantic> {
  const ColorsSemantic({
    required this.surfacePrimary,
    required this.surfaceSecondary,
    required this.onSurfacePrimary,
    required this.onSurfaceSecondary,
  });

  // ...
}
```

:::tip
If you have many top-level collections in Figma, you will see a lot of classes in this Dart file.

This might complicate the usage of your tokens in your Flutter app, so we recommend you to limit yourself to
a few top-level collections and use nested structures for more detailed Tokens.
A good start is grouping your collections by their type, like `primitive`, `semantic`, and `component`.

## Update Dependencies

Now add your Tokens package as a dependency to your Flutter app.

<Steps>
1. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file of your Flutter app and add the following line to the `dependencies` section:
    ```diff lang=yaml
    # pubspec.yaml

    dependencies:
    +  design_tokens:
    +    path: relative/path/to/your/design_tokens/
    ```

    If you decided to give your package a different name, make sure to replace `design_tokens` with the name you chose.

2. Run flutter pub get:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
</Steps>

## Using Tokens in your App

<Steps>
1. Add the generated Tokens to your app's `Theme`

    Figmage generates [`ThemeExtension`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/ThemeExtension-class.html)
    classes, which you will need to add to your app's `ThemeData` to use them.

    ```dart
    // lib/main.dart
    import 'package:design_tokens/design_tokens.dart';
    // ...
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return MaterialApp(
        theme: ThemeData(
          // ...
          extensions: [
            ColorsSemantic.standard(), // or .light() if you have modes
            TypographySemantic.standard(),
          ],
        ),
        // Add dark theme if you have it
        darkTheme: ThemeData(
          // ...
          extensions: [
            ColorsSemantic.dark(), // Only if you have a dark mode
            TypographySemantic.standard(),
          ],
        ),
        themeMode: ThemeMode.system,
        home: MyHomePage(),
      );
    }
    ```

2. Use your Tokens in your widgets:

    ```dart
    // lib/example_button.dart
    import 'package:design_tokens/design_tokens.dart';
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

    class ExampleButton extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return ElevatedButton(
          style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(
            backgroundColor: context.colorsSemantic.surfacePrimary,
            foregroundColor: context.colorsSemantic.onSurfacePrimary,
            textStyle: context.typographySemantic.headline1,
          ),
          onPressed: () {},
          child: Text('Click me!'),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
</Steps>

## Updating Tokens

Whenever your Tokens change in Figma, you can run Figmage again in the same package directory 
to automatically update your package with the latest changes:

```bash
figmage forge -t YOUR_FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
