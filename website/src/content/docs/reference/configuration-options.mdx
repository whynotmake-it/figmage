Figmage offers you a variety of configuration options to tailor the output to your needs.
This page will guide you through the available options and how to use them.

## Configuration File Location
Configuring Figmage happens mostly using a `figmage.yaml` file in the root of your package directory.

If you have followed the [Getting Started Guide](/guides/getting-started), you should already have a `figmage.yaml` file in your package directory.
In case you created a package without using a configuration file, make sure to create one now. 
It should live next to the package's `pubspec.yaml` file like so:

<FileTree> 
- design_tokens/ your generated package directory
  - lib/
  - pubspec.yaml
  - **figmage.yaml**
</FileTree>

## Configuration Options
Below is a list of all available configuration options and their default values. Scroll down to see a detailed explanation of each option.

:::info
All options are optional, so an empt


### `fileId`

Your Figma file's ID.
You can either permanently configure it here, as explained in the [Getting Started Guide](/guides/getting-started/#tell-figmage-where-to-find-your-tokens), 
or pass it as an argument every time you run Figmage like so:

```bash
figmage forge -f YOUR_FIGMA_FILE_ID -t YOUR_FIGMA_TOKEN
```

Configuring a `fileId` in the configuration file will mean you will only ever need to pass the `-t` argument when running Figmage.


### `packageName`
The name of the generated Dart package. 
Should be a valid Dart package name, see [Dart's package naming conventions](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec#name).

By default, Figmage attempts to use the package's directory name to create a name.

### `packageDescription`
The generated package's description field.
This is a free-form text field that describes the package's purpose, see [Dart's Documentation](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec#description).

Defaults to an empty string.

### `colors`
Configuration for generating color tokens.
The following sub-options are available:

- `generate`: Whether to generate color tokens of this type. Defaults to `true`.
- `from`: An array of paths to generate color tokens from.

See the [Filtering generated Tokens](#filtering-generated-tokens) section for more information.

### `typography`
Configuration for generating typography tokens.
The following sub-options are available:

- `generate`: Whether to generate typography tokens of this type. Defaults to `true`.
- `from`: An array of paths to generate typography tokens from.
- `useGoogleFonts`: Whether to use Google Fonts for font families. Defaults to `true`.

See the [Filtering generated Tokens](#filtering-generated-tokens) section for more information.

:::note[Google Fonts Availability]
When the `useGoogleFonts` flag is set (default), Figmage will use Google Fonts for
**all typography styles** in your file.

Thus, if any of your fonts are not on Google Fonts, you should set this flag to `false` and 
add the fonts to your project manually.

Checking Google Fonts availibility for each font is [planned](https://github.com/whynotmake-it/figmage/issues/29).
:::

### `numbers`, `spacers`, `paddings`
Configuration for generating number, spacer and padding tokens respectively.
All three options have the following sub-options:

- `generate`: Whether to generate tokens of this type. Defaults to `false`.
- `from`: An array of paths to generate tokens from.

See the [Filtering generated Tokens](#filtering-generated-tokens) section for more information.

### `assets`
Configuration for generating assets from Figma nodes.
The following sub-options are available:

- `generate`: Whether to generate assets. Defaults to `false`.
- `nodes`: A map of node IDs to asset configurations.

Each node configuration has:
- `name`: The name to use for the asset in code
- `scales`: List of scale factors to generate. Defaults to `[1]`

Example:
```yaml
assets:
  generate: true
  "1:5":  # Figma node ID
    name: "check"
    scales: [1, 2]
  "23:1":
    name: "example_name"
```

### `dropUnresolved`
Due to the way Figma built it's variable system, it can sometimes happen, that a variable alias points
to another variable, which has since been deleted.
This means, the alias is unresolvable and doesn't reference an actual value.
Oftentimes, variables are unresolvable in only one of their modes.

Figmage offers you two ways to deal with this. 
By default, this variables are dropped entirely, as if they had never been in your design system.
In this case, you can rely on all your generated tokens being present in all of their Modes.
However, one of your variables might only be unresolved in one of the modes, and you might not want to loose all other modes for that variable.

If you set this flag to `false`, all unresolved variables will be included in the generated tokens, but will return `null` as their value in the 
respective modes. This comes with the drawback that the variable will be nullable in all modes, and you will have to handle the null case.

### `stylesFromLibrary`
By default, Figmage fetches all styles from your Figma file, including local styles and styles from other libraries that were referenced.
Styles will be at their most recent state, so your designs in the file will never be out of sync with your Flutter code.

However, you might prefer a more controlled approach, where only published styles are used.
If you only want to generate tokens from published styles, you can set this flag to `true`.
Be aware that publishing Libraries is not possible on a free Figma account, so you will need a paid plan to use this feature.


## Filtering generated Tokens

You have two options to filter the generated tokens:

### Toggle entire Token Types
Each of the supported Token types (colors, typography, numbers, paddings, spacers) allows you to 
toggle the generation of tokens of that type using the `generate` flag.

Colors and typography are generated by default. All other tokens need to be enabled explicitly.

### Filter by Path
Colors, typography and number tokens additionally allow you to specify certain paths to generate tokens from.
This can be useful if you only want to generate a subset of your tokens.
If you don't specify any paths, all tokens of that type will be generated.

:::caution
For now, spacers and paddings mirror the generated number tokens.

This means that if you want to generate spacers or paddings, you need to **enable number tokens** as well.
Furthermore, spacers and paddings can't contain their own `from` configuration.
:::

Let's say, you only want to include tokens in the `semantic/app/` path, but include 
number tokens from the `primitive/spacing` path, your configuration file could look like this:

```yaml
# figmage.yaml
colors:
  generate: true
  from:
    - "semantic/app/"
typography:
  generate: true
  from:
    - "semantic/app/"
numbers:
  generate: true
  from:
    - "primitive/spacing"
spacers:
  generate: true
paddings:
  generate: true
```


## Example File
This is what a configured `figmage.yaml` file could look like:

```yaml
# figmage.yaml

fileId: "YOUR_FIGMA_FILE_ID"
packageName: "design_tokens"
packageDescription: "A generated package that contains all of our design tokens"
dropUnresolved: true
stylesFromLibrary: false
colors:
  generate: true # default
  from:
    - "semantic/colors"
typography:
  generate: true # default
  from:
    - "semantic/typography"
  useGoogleFonts: true
numbers:
  generate: true # false by default
  # omitting `from` will generate all number tokens
spacers:
  generate: false # false by default
paddings:
  generate: false # false by default
assets:
  generate: true # false by default
  "1:5":  # Figma node ID
    name: "check" # name of the asset
    scales: [1, 2] # different scales 
  "23:1":
    name: "example_name"
```
